## Getting Started

```shellscript
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

You need to include --legacy-peer-deps because [remix-auth-steam](https://github.com/Andreychik32/remix-auth-steam) is largely unmaintained.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

Note - For steam logins you need an API key. You can get one [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

## Env Variables

```shellscript
# Required for steam login
STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key
# Informs the application where to redirect after login. NO TRAILING SLASH
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## Deployment

Build the Dockerfile

```shellscript
docker build -t ghcr.io/triumph-tf2/website:latest .
```

You should probably use a different tag than latest. You might also want to tweak the docker-compose.yml file to your liking. An example is included [here](docker-compose.yml.example).
